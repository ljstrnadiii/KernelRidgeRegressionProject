# KernelRidgeRegressionProject
place to kee notes, code, plots and pdf for my final project in kernel ridge regression


## About:
This is a repo for my final project in Advanced Statistical Methods. The project intends to 
- introduce non-linear regression
- explain Repreoducinng Kernel Hilbert Spaces, basis expansions, and its relationship to Kernel Ridge Regression
- explore a few simulated data sets with KRR
- disuss/execute parameter tuning in the context of generalizability and cross-validation. 
- mention a few contexts in which KRR is used and discuss comparable models

## Code:
Two primary packages are used: [CVST]("https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CVST") and [DRR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DRR"). CVST allows for cross-validation via sequential testing. DRR allows for faster KRR via dimension reduction using a generalized PCA approach. Simulate data from CVST. Choose parameters: lambda and sigma.
